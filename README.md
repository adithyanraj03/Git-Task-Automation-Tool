### Advanced Usage

#### Customizing Commit Messages

Use these placeholders in your commit message templates:
- `{batch_num}` - Current batch number (Batch Mode)
- `{folder_name}` - Source folder name (Full Folder Mode)

Examples:
- `Added files from UI update - batch {batch_num}`
- `Initial import of {folder_name} assets`

#### Handling Large Repositories

For repositories with thousands of files:

1. Use smaller batch sizes (10-20 files per batch)
2. Enable selective file processing with the filter options
3. Use the log output to monitor for any Git errors

#### Integration with Workflows

The tool can be integrated into automation scripts:

```powershell
# Example PowerShell script to automate the Git Tool
Start-Process -FilePath "GitAutomationTool.exe" -ArgumentList "--source C:\project\assets --repo C:\project\repo --batch 15 --commit 'Asset batch {batch_num}' --autostart"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture

The application is built using:
- C# with WPF for the UI framework
- MVVM pattern for clean separation of concerns
- Async/await for non-blocking operations
- Windows API Code Pack for modern folder dialogs

### Performance Considerations

- Memory-efficient file handling for large directories
- Asynchronous Git operations to keep UI responsive
- Batched file copying to prevent memory spikes

### Customization

Advanced users can modify:
- Default batch sizes in the app.config
- UI themes by editing XAML resources
- Git command templates in the GitOperations.cs file
